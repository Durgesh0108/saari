                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      1. We will accept the return of only the defective product
                      and then subsequently provide for the refund. However, the
                      refund process will be initiated only post inspection and
                      after we get a go-ahead from our QA (quality assurance)
                      team. While refunding for the defective product, we will
                      not charge you for shipment (to and fro).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      2. We will refund under those circumstances where our
                      logistic partner has been unable to deliver the product,
                      even after repeated efforts due to the customer’s
                      unavailability. Although while making the refund, we will
                      deduct from the amount paid all the costs incurred by
                      Titan like shipment expenses both to and fro, customs paid
                      and any other charges.

                    1. Taneira products are made of pure and natural fabrics and
                    hence may be prone to shrinkage and colour bleed (especially

                  <p>
                    2. Given the unique and handcrafted nature of the product,
                    the dimensions & weight of the saree (and attached blouse
                    piece) may vary slightly from the dimensions declared.

                    3. The Company does not guarantee the colour/purity/content
                    of zari unless stated explicitly on the product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    4. The Company shall not be liable for any claim arising out
                    of any special, indirect, remote, economic or consequential
                    loss or damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    5. The actual color of the product may slightly vary from
