                      1. We will accept the return of only the defective product
                      and then subsequently provide for the refund. However, the
                      refund process will be initiated only post inspection and
                      after we get a go-ahead from our QA (quality assurance)
                      team. While refunding for the defective product, we will
                      not charge you for shipment (to and fro).

                    <li>
                      2. We will refund under those circumstances where our
                      logistic partner has been unable to deliver the product,
                      even after repeated efforts due to the customer’s
                      unavailability. Although while making the refund, we will
                      deduct from the amount paid all the costs incurred by
                      Titan like shipment expenses both to and fro, customs paid
                      and any other charges.
